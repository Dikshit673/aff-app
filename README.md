# React + TypeScript + Vite Template

=====================================

This is a minimal setup for a React application using TypeScript and Vite. It provides a basic structure for building a production-ready application with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules.

## Features

- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript 5.8.3
- Vite 7.0.4
- ESLint with type-aware lint rules
- Support for React-specific lint rules with eslint-plugin-react-x and eslint-plugin-react-dom

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the application
  - `App.tsx`: Main application component
  - `main.tsx`: Entry point for the application
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `features/`: Feature-specific components and logic
  - `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `redux/`: Redux store and actions
- `public/`: Static assets and index.html
- `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript configuration files
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration file
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies

## ESLint Configuration

This project uses ESLint with type-aware lint rules. To expand the configuration, you can update the `eslint.config.js` file to include additional rules and plugins.
